##### 全国大学生智能汽车竞赛源程序
- 刚入大学时的迷茫岁月还好有实验室和比赛陪伴，当时取得了二等奖，对于初次参赛的我来说心里其实挺开心的，参赛前几天不分日夜的调车算是有了一点回报，回想起来，嗯，有付出总会有回报。
- When I first entered the university, I was lucky enough to join a lab and take part in some competitions.When I won the second prize at the time, I was really happy . I didn’t have a day or night to optimize the car a few days before the competition. In retrospect, if you pay, you will have a return.
- 程序采用c语言编写，IDE用的是code warrior，使用的单片机是MC9S12XS128,组别是光电组，电路板的原理图放在了电路板文件夹里，没有放PCB。另外，有几本当时看的智能车竞赛的教程，感觉还挺不错的。
- The program is done by c language.IDE: code warrier  Single chip microcomputer:MC9S12XS128 group:Photoelectric. There are also board schematics, but I don't provide PCB.And I also provide some books about intelligent car competition.I think it may be useful for you.
